This repository is provided to answer the 3 tasks given by EES on 07.02.2020.

### Task 1: creating a demo unit to explain the Naive Bayes Classifier
The main content and the example in this unit are original. The two tasks are slightly modified versions of [here](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/m/blogpost?id=6448529%3ABlogPost%3A285052) and [here](https://youtu.be/ZAfarappAO0). Catching up with the content does not assume any prior background in statistics or data science. The exercises are aimed to be solved manually and thus there is no need to run the cells. The use of data is minimal and is limited to the tables provided in the text. This task can be reached by clicking on the following icon.

### Task 2: creating a Scikit-learn demo unit to explain the F1 Score
The main content, the example and tasks in this unit are original. For task 2 though I benefited from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). To get the best out if this unit one requires basic knowledge of Python and Scikit-learn library as well as running certain cells. This task can be reached by clicking on the following icon.
